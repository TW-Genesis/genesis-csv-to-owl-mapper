# CSV to OWL

The `generate-ontology.sh` script from `csv_to_owl` folder can be used to convert the ontology from csv format to the owl format. The script looks up for the following csv files into the `csw_to_owl/csv` directory:

1. `entities.csv` : this file contains all the classes in ontology with their IRIs, labels, definations etc

2. `relations.csv` : this file contains all the relations in ontology with their IRIs, labels, definations etc

3. `instances.csv` : this file contains all the instances predefined in ontology with their IRIs, labels, definations etc

The `app.config.sh` file contain configuration variables for some metadata needed to generate ontology. The ontology can be generated by running the script:

```
./generate-ontology.sh
```

Please refer the comments in the script for more information on how it works.

### ToDo:
*  Currently all the columns names are hard coded in the `mapping.ttl` file. Need to store all the configurations in single separate file.

### Limitations: 
* cannot add constraints
* No automated way to add properties for custom entities
